# Student Manager Application

We'll design this type of sample Android App using `SQLite` database to store data. Here I've created three tables `student`, `subject` and `student_subject`. Here `student_subject` is a pivot table. This table will store data which student is taken which subjects.

Student Manager app is easy to use Java and SQLite based app which helps you in managing the Students and their data simultaneously. CRUD operation is used both on student as well as on different subject list in thid app. One can easily use this interface to hold a student's data
